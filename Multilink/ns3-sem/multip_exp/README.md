- multi_links-sem.cc: takes line command arguments (for ns3-sem), creates dynamically multiple links, creates an On_off app sending udp from node 1 to node 0 without link failures, generate both .pcap and flowmonitor files but the output of the flowmonitor (flow stats is output in the shell). This file calls the the other two py files to parse the stats files and generate their output in the shell. 
- multi-link_flow_parser.py and multi-link_parse_pcap.py parse respectively the flowmonitor and the pcap files. (the command line uses python from a miniconda environment where packages like pyshark, pandas, seaborn... should be installed (look at the environment.yml file in the Home page of the repo for the used dependencies))
- multi_links-sem.ipynb: uses sem to generate multiple experiments, gets the results and creates a dataframe of all the KPIs needed. Then transforms each experiment into a graph for further use.
