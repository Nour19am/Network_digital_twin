Simulation files:


Based on traffic-control.cc (to impelement queues and generate traces), pfifo-fast-queue-disc-test-suite.cc (for DSCP marking), and wifi-multi-tos.cc (for different sockets attached to different tos values) provided in ns3's repo, we adapted and created those files:
- n-dscp_mflow_traces.cc implements a pfifo_fast with 3 TOS-type packets (maximize througput 0x08->queue 2, normal service: 0x00 -> queue 1, minimize delay: 0x10 -> queue 0) to ensure & check that each TOS is going through the right queue. It outputs also stats about the queues (for now printed in the shell)


Output files:
In the Output/ folder you will find: 
- qdisc_dscp_2_nodes.xml: the flowmonitor trace for per-flow stats
- qdisc-animation.xml: animation file to visualize using NetAnim
- qdisc_dscp-0-0.pcap and qdisc_dscp-1-0.pcap: pcap files for per-packet stats

  
Parsing files:
- n-qdisc_dscp_parse.ipynb enables parsing the output file to have two types of granularities: parsing of the pcap file using tshark gives statistics per-packet and per-flow statistics are given using the parsing of the .xml reading option of the flowmonitor file  


Next: Add flow monitor and traces to:
- check DSCP marks per socket
- check Flows are continuoulsy generated by each socket (ok see wifi-multi-tos for reference)
- check that the child queues are used for scheduling
- generate scenarios where packets are dropped (ok by having datarate of hosts> capacity of the link)
- provide csv file to the model
- adapt code to complex topologies (to consider for later automatization)
- explore wifi-multi-tos.cc to impelement correctly the TOS
- add queues stats printed in the shell to the parsing file (.ipynb) from n-dscp_mflow_traces.cc
