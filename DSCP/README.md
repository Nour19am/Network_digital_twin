Simulation files:


Based on example files provided in ns3's repo (under the ns3 helper examples/ directory), we adapted and created those files:
- n-dscp_mflow_traces.cc implements a pfifo_fast with 3 TOS-type packets (maximize througput 0x08->queue 2, normal service: 0x00 -> queue 1, minimize delay: 0x10 -> queue 0) to ensure & check that each TOS is going through the right queue. It outputs also stats about the queues (for now printed in the shell)


Output files:
In the Output/ folder you will find: 
- qdisc_dscp_2_nodes.xml: the flowmonitor trace for per-flow stats
- qdisc-animation.xml: animation file to visualize using NetAnim
- qdisc_dscp-0-0.pcap and qdisc_dscp-1-0.pcap: pcap files for per-packet stats

  
Parsing files:
- n-qdisc_dscp_parse.ipynb enables parsing the output file to have two types of granularities: parsing of the pcap file using tshark gives statistics per-packet and per-flow statistics are given using the parsing of the .xml reading option of the flowmonitor file  


Next: Add flow monitor and traces to:
- check DSCP marks per socket (**---ok---**)
- check Flows are continuoulsy generated by each socket  (**---ok---**)
- check that the child queues are used for scheduling (**---ok---**)
- generate scenarios where packets are dropped (**---working on it---**)
- provide csv file to the model (**---ok---**)
- adapt code to complex topologies (to consider for later automatization) (**---working on it, need to change the parameters---**)
- add queues stats printed in the shell to the parsing file (.ipynb) from n-dscp_mflow_traces.cc (**---to be done---**)
