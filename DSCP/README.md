Based on traffic-control.cc provided in ns3's repo under example/traffic-control/ directory, we adapted and created those files:
- n-dscp_test_unique.cc generates traffic through a socket attached to a TOS between 2 nodes
- n-dscp_test_unique.cc creates 3 sockets attached to 3 different TOS between 2 nodes to use prioirty queues.

Next: Add flow monitor and traces to:
- check DSCP marks per socket
- check Flows are continuoulsy generated by each socket
- check that the child queues are used for scheduling
- generate scenarios where packet are dropped
- provide csv file to the model
- adapt code to complex topologies
