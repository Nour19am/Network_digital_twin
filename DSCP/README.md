Simulation files:


Based on traffic-control.cc (to impelement queues and generate traces), pfifo-fast-queue-disc-test-suite.cc (for DSCP marking), and wifi-multi-tos(for different sockets attached to different tos values) provided in ns3's repo, we adapted and created those files:
- n-dscp_test_unique.cc generates traffic through one socket attached to a TOS between 2 nodes (one flow)
- n-dscp_test_mflow.cc creates 3 sockets attached to 3 different TOS between 2 nodes to use prioirty queues (3 different flows)
- n-dscp-test_mflow_traces provides pcap files to parse with python using tshark for packets characteristics and flowmonitor file for flow characteristics. Also outputs metrics for the queues (overall dropped packets in queues or in NIC, throughput, sent packets per DSCP class)

Output files:
In the Output/ folder you will find: 
- qdisc_dscp_2_nodes.xml: the flowmonitor trace for per-flow stats
- qdisc-animation.xml: animation file to visualize using NetAnim
- qdisc_dscp-0-0.pcap and qdisc_dscp-1-0.pcap: pcap files for per-packet stats

  
Parsing files:
- n-qdisc_dscp_parse.ipynb enables parsing the output file to have two types of granularities: parsing of the pcap file using tshark gives statistics per-packet and per-flow statistics are given using the parsing of the .xml reading option of the flowmonitor file  


Next: Add flow monitor and traces to:
- check DSCP marks per socket
- check Flows are continuoulsy generated by each socket (ok see wifi-multi-tos for reference)
- check that the child queues are used for scheduling
- generate scenarios where packets are dropped (ok by having datarate of hosts> capacity of the link)
- provide csv file to the model
- adapt code to complex topologies (to consider for later automatization)
- explore wifi-multi-tos.cc to impelement correctly the TOS
